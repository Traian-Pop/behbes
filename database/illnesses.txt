Colds|A common cold is a viral infection of your baby's nose and throat. Nasal congestion and a runny nose are the main indicators of a cold. Babies are especially susceptible to the common cold, in part because they're often around other older children. Also, they have yet to develop immunity to many common infections. Within the first year of life, most babies have up to seven colds; more if they’re in child care centers.|10 Remedies at Home;http://www.parents.com/health/cold-flu/cold/natural-cold-cough-remedies/|Age by Age Guide to Cold Medication;   https://www.babycenter.com/0_age-by-age-guide-to-kids-fever-cough-and-cold-medicine_10315565.bc|Babycenter;https://www.babycenter.com/0_fever-in-babies_84.bc;Healthline;http://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/baby-fever-101#1;HealthyChildren;https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Children-and-Colds.aspx

Baby Acne|Baby acne is acne that develops on a newborn's skin. Baby acne can occur anywhere on the face, but usually appears on the cheeks, nose and forehead. Baby acne is common — and temporary. There's little you can do to prevent baby acne. Baby acne usually clears up on its own, without scarring. It often develops within the first two to four weeks after birth.|Good Skin Care;http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=bathing-and-skin-care-90-P02628|Usually Disappears on it’s own within a few months if not talk to your pediatrician;None|Health Line;http://www.healthline.com/health/childrens-health/baby-acne;Parents;http://www.parents.com/baby/care/american-baby-how-tos/how-to-treat-baby-acne/;BabyCenter;https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-acne_72.bc
Colic|Colic is not a disease or diagnosis but a combination of baffling behaviors. It's really just a catch-all term for problem crying in otherwise healthy babies — the problem being, there’s no solution to it besides the passing of time. And it’s common, occurring in one in five infants. Episodes can go on for hours at a time, sometimes late into the night.

Cradle Cap|Doctors call it infantile seborrheic dermatitis, and it's very common. Cradle cap isn't cute, but it's harmless. It shows up most often in the first few months of life and usually clears up on its own in about six to 12 months – although some children have it for longer. You might notice the same condition around your baby's ears or eyebrows, on his eyelids, or even in his armpits and other creases.| Natural Fixes; https://draxe.com/cradle-cap/|Consult your Pediatrition Before Using;None| Patient; https://patient.info/health/seborrhoeic-dermatitis-in-babies-cradle-cap; Babycenter; https://www.babycenter.com/0_cradle-cap-infantile-seborrheic-dermatitis_80.bc; Kids Health; http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cradle-cap.html
Dehydration| If your baby's dehydrated, it means that it doesn't have as much fluid in its body as it needs. Babies and children are more prone to dehydration than adults, and it can happen if your baby takes in less fluid than it loses through vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or sweating. Dehydration can be mild and easily corrected, moderate, or severe and life threatening.| Give your Child Plenty to Drink;None|None;None| Babycenter; https://www.babycenter.com/0_dehydration-in-babies_11527.bc; Healthy Center; https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/dehydration.aspx; Parents; http://www.parents.com/baby/health/sick-baby/baby-dehydrated/
Diaper Rash|Diaper rash appears on the skin under a diaper and typically occurs in infants and children younger than 2 years. Almost every baby will get diaper rash at least once during the first 3 years of life, with the majority of these babies 9-12 months old. This is the time when the baby is still sitting most of the time and is also eating solid foods, which may change the acidity of the bowel movements.| Home Remedies; https://www.care.com/c/stories/4661/7-home-remedies-for-diaper-rash/| Diaper Rash Cream; http://www.healthline.com/health/childrens-health/best-diaper-rash-creams#1| BabyCenter; https://www.babycenter.com/0_diaper-rash_81.bc; Family Doctor; https://familydoctor.org/condition/diaper-rash/;Kids Health; http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/diaper-rash.html 
Ear Infections|An ear infection can be caused by bacteria or a virus. It happens when fluid builds up in the area behind your baby's eardrum and then becomes infected. Normally any fluid that enters this area drains quickly through the eustachian tubes, which connect the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat. But if a eustachian tube is blocked – as often happens during colds, sinus infections, even allergies – the fluid gets trapped in the middle ear. Babies are more prone to ear infections because they have short (about half an inch), horizontal eustachian tubes. As children grow to adulthood, their tubes triple in length and become more vertical, so fluid can drain more easily|Natural Remedies; http://www.healthline.com/health/childrens-health/remedies-for-baby-ear-infection#overview1| Antibiotics; http://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/antibiotics-for-ear-infections-in-children/|BabyCenter; https://www.babycenter.com/0_ear-infections-in-babies_83.bc; Partens; http://www.parents.com/baby/health/ear-infection/how-to-tell-if-its-an-ear-infection/;US Department of Health; https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/ear-infections-children
Infection|Kiss or touch your baby's forehead. If you think he feels hotter than normal, you're probably right. A higher-than-normal body temperature is called a fever.

Jaundice|Jaundice is very common in newborn babies. It is usually easy to spot because the baby’s skin and whites of the eyes turn a yellow colour. Babies become jaundiced when they have too much bilirubin in their blood.Bilirubin is a normal pigment made when red blood cells break down in the body. It is usually processed by the liver, recycled and eliminated in the baby’s stool. When a baby has jaundice, it means either his body is making too much bilirubin or the liver is not getting rid of it quickly enough.|Home Remedies; http://www.livestrong.com/article/22715-home-remedies-newborn-jaundice/| Phototherapy; http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1894477-overview?pa=SlcYl1WeW9ZnUElno8mOM16YLJmUmzm5OW60J7O1c5XH5VNVYRki5Ode4FbSl%2BC6i66xtcx5CyapkBgjIB1BDzaX%2B0yjVSjiGm4o1qH%2F6Uk%3D| National Library of Medicine; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528723/; BabyCenter; https://www.babycenter.com/0_jaundice_89.bc; American Pregnancy; http://americanpregnancy.org/first-year-of-life/newborn-jaundice/
Oral Thrush|Oral thrush is a very common yeast infection in babies. It causes irritation in and around a baby's mouth. Most people (including infants) naturally have Candida in their mouths and digestive tracts, which is considered normal growth. Usually, a healthy immune system and some "good" bacteria control the amount of this fungus in the body. But if the immune system is not fully developed (as in babies), Candida in the digestive tract can overgrow and lead to an infection in the mouth. | Home Remedies;  https://www.easybabylife.com/thrush.html#Effective%20%20Baby%20Thrush%20Home%20Remedies| Nystatin; https://patient.info/medicine/nystatin-for-oral-thrush-nystan; Micronazole; https://patient.info/medicine/miconazole-for-oral-thrush-daktarin| Baby Care; http://www.babycareadvice.com/article/detail/Thrush;Mayo Clinic; http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/oral-thrush/home/ovc-20342105;Pregnagncy Birth and Baby; https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/oral-thrush-in-babies 
Seasonal Allergy (Hay Fever)| Seasonal allergies, commonly referred to as hay fever, are the body's reaction to airborne particles such as pollen or mold. This type of allergy kicks up at the times of year when certain trees, grasses, or weeds are in flower, or when mold releases its spores into the air. A combination of genetics and interaction with environmental allergens causes some people to develop seasonal allergies. People with hay fever seem to have a hyper-alert immune system that's always on the lookout for substances foreign to the body.|Treatment Tips; http://www.parents.com/baby/health/allergy/baby-allergies-prevention/| Anthistamine; http://pediatricsofavon.com/pdf/Pediatrics-of-Avon--Childrens-Dosage-Guide.pdf| BabyCenter; https://www.babycenter.com/0_seasonal-allergies-hay-fever-in-children_66242.bc; Parents; http://www.parents.com/baby/health/allergy/all-about-baby-allergies/;Kids Health; http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/seasonal-allergies.html 
Seizures|If your child is suddenly unresponsive and staring vacantly, or seems to be twitching involuntarily, she may be having a mild seizure. Mild seizures usually last from a few seconds to a few minutes.  If your child becomes unconscious, falls to the floor, and twitches or flails, she may be having a more serious seizure. It will probably last only two to three minutes, but in rare cases they last longer, and she may lose bowel and bladder control. There are many different types of seizures and they can last anywhere from a few moments to more than half an hour. Seizures occur when the nerve cells in the brain fire abnormally as a result of nerve damage, problems with the brain's chemistry, or a high fever. Both nerve damage and brain chemistry irregularities can be caused by a birth defect or by an injury to the brain or nervous system, such as a blow to the head.These febrile seizures are usually harmless and quite common in children between 6 months and 5 years old. Young children also sometimes hold their breath involuntarily when they're injured, frightened, or angry, which can lead to a seizure, but they usually grow out of the impulse within a few years.|No Natural Treatments Are Currently Known;None| Treatments; https://uichildrens.org/health-library/epilepsy-young-children-what-treatment| BabyCenter; https://www.babycenter.com/0_seizure_10907.bc;Parents; http://www.parents.com/baby/health/other-issues/signs-of-seizures-in-babies/; Epilepsy; http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/seizures-youth/about-newborns-and-infants/seizures-newborns
Tear Duct Obstruction|Many babies are born with an underdeveloped tear-duct system, a problem that can lead to tear-duct blockage, excess tearing, and infection.Blocked tear ducts are common in infants; as many as one third may be born with this condition. Fortunately, more than 90% of all cases clear up by the time children are 1 year old with little or no treatment.| At-Home Treatments; http://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/baby-blocked-tear-duct#2| If it doesn’t go away contact your pediatrician;None| Kids Health; https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/tear-duct-obstruct-surgery.html;BabyCenter; https://www.babycenter.com/0_blocked-tear-ducts-in-babies_10403185.bc; Patient; https://patient.info/health/tear-duct-blockage-in-babies
